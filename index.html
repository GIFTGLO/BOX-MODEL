    <p class="sample1">Rabbits are mammals, which are warm blooded animals with backbones. They like to live in groups and dig tunnels under
    the ground to protect themselves. They are prey and have many predators that like to eat them. Rabbits are herbivores,
    which means they like to eat only plants.</p>
